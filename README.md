# accelo-test

HTML Documentation located inside docs/

There is a copy of the docs that is in Markdown for use on Github. I recommend getting the documentation and rendering it locally in your web browser, it looks significantly nicer.

There is a venv environment if you need that, otherwise do: `pip install salt-ssh` on your machine.

Create a new key with the name accelo-prod inside AWS as per the documentation.

Place your key here with the name accelo-prod.pem

Now run `sh automate.sh`.

This will take some time. Get a coffee, biscuit and chill.
